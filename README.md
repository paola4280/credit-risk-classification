# credit-risk-classification
This is a Supervised ML, with a Logistic Regression Model challenge

The file with the notebook code is called credit_risk_classification. It's in the Credit Risk Folder, and the data is in the Resources folder.

In this challenge, the main objective is to understand and apply machine learning techniques to classify loan risk and determine the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using a dataset of historical lending activity, the goal is to build and evaluate models that can predict whether a loan is healthy (low risk) or high-risk. This involves preparing the data by splitting it into training and testing sets, applying fundamental classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. By the end of the challenge, there will be a trained model that can identify high-risk loans effectively.

The challenge also focuses on key concepts like supervised learning, where labeled data is used to train classification models. Additionally, how algorithms like SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN work as classifiers and how they differ from one another. For example, SVMs separate data into two classes using a hyperplane, Decision Trees create decision paths based on feature splits, Random Forest combines multiple trees for better performance, and KNN predicts based on the closest neighbors. Additionally, the challenge includes examples of evaluating these models using tools like confusion matrices and classification reports, gaining insight into their strengths and weaknesses. This knowledge will help build, test, and refine machine learning models for accurate predictions in real-world scenarios.

For guidance during this assignment, I mostly used class notes.  For debugging I used ChatGPT.
